## Concise Introduction

`useState` is React's fundamental state management hook that gives functional components memory. It is one of the most commonly used hooks.

### Basic usage pattern

```jsx
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)

setValue(5)
setValue(prev => prev + 1) // Functional update (safe for sequential updates)
```

## Key Characteristics

### 1. State Isolation

Each component instance maintains its own state

### 2. Update Triggers

Calling the setter function(like setValue) will trigger a re-render

**Batching Updates**

Batching updates is a crucial performance optimization mechanism in React that combines multiple state updates into a single re-render.

```jsx
// Multiple state updates trigger only one re-render
function handleClick() {
  setCount(c => c + 1) // Update 1
  setName("John") // Update 2
  setAge(30) // Update 3
  // React will perform just one render after all updates, not three
}
```

After React 18, introduced "automatic batching" for almost all updates, including:

- Event handlers
- useEffect callbacks
- Custom hooks

### 3. Initialization

Accepts initial value or initialization function for expensive computations

**Initial State Computation**

```jsx
// ❌ Avoid expensive init
const [data] = useState(computeExpensiveValue())

// ✅ Lazy initialization
const [data] = useState(() => computeExpensiveValue())
```

## Key Considerations

### Closure Trap

The closure trap happens when your component re-renders, but event handlers or callbacks "remember" the state values from when they were created, rather than using the latest state values.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  // This function "captures" the count value at the time it was created
  const handleClick = () => {
    // If count is 0, no matter how many times you click, it will only set count to 1
    setCount(count + 1)
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Count: {count}</button>
}
```

**Why does it happen?**

This occurs due to the combination of JavaScript's closure mechanism and React's rendering model:

1. With each render, React creates a "new version" of your component function
2. This version has its own props and state values
3. Functions defined within the component capture variable values from the current render
4. Even when state updates, these functions still reference the old values from when they were created

**The solution**

Use the functional update pattern, Functional updates receive the most recent state as an argument.

React guarantees providing the current up-to-date state value, not the closure-captured value.

This approach doesn't rely on state references within closures.

```jsx
// ✅ Correct approach
const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1) // Uses the latest state
}
```

### Other ways to avoid Closure Traps

1.  Proper useEffect dependencies

Ensure dependency arrays include all states being used

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // ❌ Stale state dependency
  console.log(count)
}, [])

// ✅ Proper dependency array
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(count)
}, [count])
```

2. Use useRef

For values that need to be shared between closures without triggering rerenders

## Best Practices

- Use `useState` for simple state, `useReducer` for complex logic
- Merge related states into objects
- Never mutate state directly
- Use controlled components for forms
