## Concise Introduction

useEffect is one of React's core Hooks, designed to handle "side effects" in components. Side effects are operations that don't directly relate to rendering but need to be performed, such as data fetching, subscription management, and manual DOM manipulations.

useEffect is a powerful tool for handling complex logic in functional components, and understanding its correct usage is crucial for building high-quality React applications.

### Basic Pattern

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code

  // Optional cleanup function
  return () => {
    // Cleanup work (unsubscribe, clear timers, etc.)
  }
}, [dependencyArray]) // Optional dependency array
```

## How It Works

### 1. Execution Timing

Runs after the component renders to the screen

### 2. Dependency Control

Re-executes only when dependencies change

**Key Role of the Dependency Array**

- `Empty array []`: Executes once on mount, cleans up on unmount
- `With dependencies [a, b]`: Executes when a or b changes
- `No dependency array`: Executes after every render
- All reactive values used in the effect should be included in the dependency array

### 3. Cleanup Mechanism

Calls the cleanup function before component unmount or before re-running the effect, Forgetting to clean up effects can lead to memory leaks.

## Comparison with Class Component Lifecycle Methods

- `useEffect(fn, [])` ≈ componentDidMount + componentWillUnmount
- `useEffect(fn)` ≈ componentDidMount + componentDidUpdate + componentWillUnmount
- `useEffect(fn, [dependencies])` ≈ Conditional componentDidUpdate

## Best Practices

1. Always specify dependencies explicitly
2. Clean up every effect that needs it
3. Use custom hooks for complex logic
4. Prefer smaller focused effects
